# ETH Global Brussels '24 Hackathon Project

NEAR Bounties: Chain Signatures & User Owned AI (https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels/prizes#near-protocol)

# Overview
The Terminator Governor is the name we've given to our next-gen AI Governance Agent. Next generation because it leverages AI while placing control back on user's hands AND bringin down the barriers that have held back web3. During this hackathon we:
1. Deployed our own AI Oracle on NEAR Testnet that requests and receives prompts from OpenAI (Original repo https://github.com/evgenykuzyakov/onchain-ai)
2. Established chain signatures with Ethereum to be able to sign DAO proposals on any EVM
